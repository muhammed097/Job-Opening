# Job-Opening

# Job Listings Project

This is a simple job listings project that displays available job openings on a webpage. Users can click an "Apply" button to see more details about each job.

## Features

- Displays a list of job openings.
- Shows job details in a popup when the "Apply" button is clicked.
- Custom description for a specific job.

## How It Works

1. **Job Data**:  
   The job information (title, location, job ID, description) is stored in the `jobs` array in the code.

2. **Rendering Jobs**:  
   The `renderJobs()` function creates HTML for each job and shows it on the webpage.

3. **Popup for Job Details**:  
   When a user clicks "Apply," the `showPopup()` function shows a popup with the job title and description. If the job is 'Tele-calling Executive,' a custom description is shown.

4. **Closing the Popup**:  
   The `closePopup()` function hides the popup when the user closes it.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The job listings will be displayed.
3. Click the "Apply" button to see more details in a popup.

## Customization

- **Add New Jobs**:  
  Add more jobs to the `jobs` array in the code.
  
- **Change Job Details**:  
  Update the `showPopup()` function to modify popup content for specific jobs.
